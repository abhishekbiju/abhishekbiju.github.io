I'm a Software Developer, Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher and a Senior studying Computer Science, Data Science & Math at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
I like spending my time immersed in software and data to build elegant solutions that empower us. During my degree, I have had the change to intern at Safeguard L.L.C, flydubai, Datafortune Software Solutions, and TNIE. 
I find beauty in simplicity and am enamored by minimalistic design and innovation. In my leisure time I enjoy weightlifting, reading, music and watching sports.
